The specimen consists of three pieces of\X0D\tissue each measuring 2mm in maximal dimension. All for frozen section.\X0D\All embedded (1 block) \X0D\\X0D\2.\R\Right ovary and tube. Fresh\R\. The specimen consists of a largely\X0D\encapsulated mass with adherent fallopian tube measuring 195x150x100mm\X0D\and weighing 1281g in total. The fallopian tube measures 80mm in length\X0D\x 7mm in diameter. The outer surface of the mass is heterogeneous with\X0D\fluctuant and solid areas. There is a capsular defect at one aspect\X0D\measuring 46x16mm. The specimen is received fresh and tissue is taken\X0D\for the innovate studies.

The serosal surface is smooth and congested with a cuff of\X0D\peritoneum anteriorly measuring up to 35mm in width. The ectocervix\X0D\measures 35mm in maximum extent and appears unremarkable. The anterior\X0D\margin is inked blue, posterior is inked black and orange ink marks the\X0D\false margin created by the removal of the parametrium. The myometrium\X0D\measures up to 23mm thick while the endometrium measures 2mm thick.\X0D\There are scars in the anterior lower uterine segment.

The capsular surface of the ovary is\X0D\fluctuant and cystic with focal granular areas. On slicing the ovary is\X0D\partially solid, partially cystic and multiloculated with thin as well\X0D\as gelatinous material. The solid component is pale white with foci of\X0D\soft yellow material, 42mm in maximal extent. There are haemorrhagic\X0D\follicles at the periphery. Representative sections.

The specimen consists of an irregular\X0D\piece of fibroadipose tissue with a partially smooth grey surface\X0D\measuring 30x25x10mm. The tissue is divided and the cut surface shows\X0D\heterogeneous light to dark brown tissue. All embedded. (Block A and B:\X0D\A - 5p, B - 3p) \X0D\\X0D\5.\R\Left round ligament peritoneum\R\. The specimen consists of an\X0D\irregular piece of fibroadipose tissue with an overlying smooth grey\X0D\surface measuring 19x12x5mm. The tissue is divided and all embedded (1\X0D\block) \X0D\\X0D\6.\R\Subtotal colectomy\R\. The specimen consists of a segment of large\X0D\bowel measuring 380mm in total length with a circumference of 80mm\X0D\proximally, 50mm mid and 60mm distally. The anterior peritoneal\X0D\reflection is not identified. The mesocolic fat is 60mm in width. The\X0D\omental fat measures 375x150x20mm. There is a full thickness defect\X0D\noted within the bowel wall adjacent to a mucosal polyp 50x20mm, 65mm\X0D\from the proximal margin. The serosal surface elsewhere is focally firm\X0D\with small areas of fibrous adhesions. A region of fat wrapping is\X0D\noted 225mm from the proximal resection margin, 125mm from the distal\X0D\resection margin. The mucosal surface shows multiple sessile and\X0D\pedunculated polyps numbering up to 84, lying 2mm from the proximal\X0D\margin and 3mm from the distal margin. The polyps range in size from\X0D\2mm to 35mm in maximal dimension, with sixteen polyps measuring over\X0D\10mm in maximal dimension. The largest polyp is 20mm from the proximal\X0D\margin with a large polyp 50mm from the distal margin. Associated with\X0D\the area of fat wrapping there is a tortuous area of bowel with a\X0D\peripherally polypoid tumour measuring 40x35mm,  225mm from the\X0D\proximal margin and 125mm from the distal margin. The serosa in this\X0D\area is puckered with the bowel adherent upon itself. On slicing\X0D\through the tumour it continues through the muscularis propria to a\X0D\depth of 13mm and abuts the serosal surface. At the mesocolic aspect\X0D\the tumour continues through the muscularis propria to a depth of 18mm\X0D\to abut the serosal surface in the region of firm serosal puckering.\X0D\The tumour is 5mm from the non peritonealised radial margin.  On the\X0D\serosal surface immediately adjacent to the non-peritonealised radial\X0D\margin is a pale nodule measuring 8mm in maximal extent. On slicing\X0D\through the bowel wall there is a tan/orange deposit measuring 8mm in\X0D\maximal extent. Within the omentum is a partially smooth dark brown\X0D\area measuring 30x26mm. One pale solid nodule is identified within the\X0D\omental fat, 12mm in maximal extent.

DSP~70~1~  
DSP~71~1~  5. \R\Left round ligament peritoneum\R\. The specimen consists of an
DSP~72~1~  irregular piece of fibroadipose tissue with an overlying smooth grey

DSP~74~1~  block)
DSP~75~1~  
DSP~76~1~  6. \R\Subtotal colectomy\R\. The specimen consists of a segment of large
DSP~77~1~  bowel measuring 380mm in total length with a circumference of 80mm
DSP~78~1~  proximally, 50mm mid and 60mm distally. The anterior peritoneal
DSP~79~1~  reflection is not identified. The mesocolic fat is 60mm in width. The
DSP~80~1~  omental fat measures 375x150x20mm. There is a full thickness defect
DSP~81~1~  noted within the bowel wall adjacent to a mucosal polyp 50x20mm, 65mm
DSP~82~1~  from the proximal margin. The serosal surface elsewhere is focally firm
DSP~83~1~  with small areas of fibrous adhesions. A region of fat wrapping is
DSP~84~1~  noted 225mm from the proximal resection margin, 125mm from the distal
DSP~85~1~  resection margin. The mucosal surface shows multiple sessile and
DSP~86~1~  pedunculated polyps numbering up to 84, lying 2mm from the proximal
DSP~87~1~  margin and 3mm from the distal margin. The polyps range in size from
DSP~88~1~  2mm to 35mm in maximal dimension, with sixteen polyps measuring over
DSP~89~1~  10mm in maximal dimension. The largest polyp is 20mm from the proximal
DSP~90~1~  margin with a large polyp 50mm from the distal margin. Associated with
DSP~91~1~  the area of fat wrapping there is a tortuous area of bowel with a
DSP~92~1~  peripherally polypoid tumour measuring 40x35mm, 225mm from the
DSP~93~1~  proximal margin and 125mm from the distal margin. The serosa in this
DSP~94~1~  area is puckered with the bowel adherent upon itself. On slicing
DSP~95~1~  through the tumour it continues through the muscularis propria to a
DSP~96~1~  depth of 13mm and abuts the serosal surface. At the mesocolic aspect
DSP~97~1~  the tumour continues through the muscularis propria to a depth of 18mm
DSP~98~1~  to abut the serosal surface in the region of firm serosal puckering.
DSP~99~1~  The tumour is 5mm from the non peritonealised radial margin. On the
DSP~100~1~  serosal surface immediately adjacent to the non-peritonealised radial
DSP~101~1~  margin is a pale nodule measuring 8mm in maximal extent. On slicing
DSP~102~1~  through the bowel wall there is a tan/orange deposit measuring 8mm in
DSP~103~1~  maximal extent. Within the omentum is a partially smooth dark brown
DSP~104~1~  area measuring 30x26mm. One pale solid nodule is identified within the
DSP~105~1~  omental fat, 12mm in maximal extent. The proximal margin is inked blue,
DSP~106~1~  distal margin is inked black and non-peritonealised margin also inked
DSP~107~1~  black. Polyps over 5mm are embedded.

DSP~214~1~  6. Sections of large bowel show moderately differentiated
DSP~215~1~  adenocarcinoma. It shows complex cribriform glandular architecture
DSP~216~1~  surrounding necrosis, with cells showing moderate to marked nuclear
DSP~217~1~  atypia with large nuclei and nucleoli. There are frequent mitotic
DSP~218~1~  figures. It shows transmural invasion into pericolic fat and involves
DSP~219~1~  serosal surface (eg 6AB, 6AC, 6AE). Perineural and lymphovascular
DSP~220~1~  invasion, including extramural venous invasion, are seen (eg 6AE, 6AH).

DSP~224~1~   Multiple serrated polyps are sampled, including hyperplastic polyps,
DSP~225~1~  sessile serrated polyps, and traditional serrated adenomas with
DSP~226~1~  tubulovillous architecture and low to high grade dysplasia (6B, 6C, 6Y).
DSP~227~1~   One shows submucosal invasion (6B and 6C). The largest polyp shows

DSP~243~1~  9. Sections show large bowel mucosa and submucosa with features
DSP~244~1~  consistent with sessile serrated polyp. There is no evidence of
DSP~245~1~  dysplasia or malignancy.
DSP~246~1~  
DSP~247~1~  10. Sections of appendix show features in keeping with goblet cell-rich
DSP~248~1~  hyperplastic polyp at the tip. No granulomas or parasites are seen. No
DSP~249~1~  evidence of dysplasia or malignancy is seen.
DSP~250~1~  
DSP~251~1~  IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
DSP~252~1~  
DSP~253~1~  2, 6. Immunostains show adenocarcinoma to be positive for keratin 20
DSP~254~1~  with diffuse strong CDX2 and SATB2 expression, and negative for keratin
DSP~255~1~  7 and PAX8. MMR gene proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6) show intact
DSP~256~1~  nuclear expression. The tumour cells are positive for BRAF (VE1). The
DSP~257~1~  immunoprofile is supportive of primary colonic adenocarcinoma.

DSP~259~1~  COMMENT:
DSP~260~1~  
DSP~261~1~  6. The presence of multiple serrated polyps raise the possibility of
